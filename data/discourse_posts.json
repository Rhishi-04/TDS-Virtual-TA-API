I\u2019ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?As the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation?Thank you and RegardsAkshit"

There was no mention of any bonus marks, and we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7 before the deadline. Because of other academic commitments like Project 2, some of us couldn\u2019t complete GA7.Recently, we found out that some students received an email saying they\u2019ve been given +5 bonus marks for GA7, which directly affects their final score and possibly their overall grade. Since this information wasn\u2019t shared earlier, we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn the bonus marks. This could be through a submission review or another form of assessment.We genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too.Best regards,Palaash V. Upadhyay"

I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance.The assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon as possible.Thank you for your support."

Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible.These things do matter when done at scale.  Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These \u201cminor\u201d things matter.Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.Kindest regards"

The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.Kind regards"

    "content": "@s.anand@carlton@JivrajDear TDS Team,I hope you are doing well. I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution.1. Graded Assignments (GA)GA6 Doubts Unresolved:While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided.(Thread link)GA Platform Changes:Initially, we were solving questions onexam.sanand.workers.dev. However, in GA6, we moved toSeekand in GA7, toGoogle Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.2. Project UpdatesProject 1:The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.Project 2:There are multiple doubts posted in theProject 2discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved?(thread link)3. ROE Score UpdateWhile ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response.Best regards,Lakshay"

    "content": "lakshaygarg654:GA Platform Changes:Initially, we were solving questions onexam.sanand.workers.dev. However, in GA6, we moved toSeekand in GA7, toGoogle Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.lakshaygarg654:Project 1:The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway.lakshaygarg654:3. ROE Score UpdateWhile ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed.Kind regards"

    "content": "Thank you for your response@carltonand for addressing our concerns. We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience.The reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.We will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100.Meanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated.Looking forward to your response.Regards,Lakshay"

I assume this might be a backend issue or that the scores are still being updated. Could you kindly look into this and confirm?Thank you10000327121080\u00d71032 90.3 KB"

    "content": "@23f2003413We will have it uploaded sometime this morning.It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:The chaos of ROE.The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quicklyWorkflow of ROE: Data Extraction \u2192 Data Cleaning \u2192 Data Transformation \u2192 Data Analyisis \u2192 Information to answer questionsThe pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).How limited the time is.The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.Today\u2019s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.Kind regards"

    "content": "Dear@jkmadathil@Anand@BharathiFirst and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of theTDS teamin supporting us throughout this course. Thelive sessions and guidancehave been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.Key Challenges FacedLack of PrerequisitesThis course did not list anyprerequisites, leading many students\u2014including those fromnon-technical backgrounds\u2014to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that thecourse content, assignments, and projectshave been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.Project Complexity & Deadline PressureThedifficulty of the projectshas been overwhelming, requiring most of us torely heavily on peer supportjust to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past FeedbackMany students joinedTDSbased on pastDiscourse posts and feedback, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition\u2014especially forworking professionalsand students without prior experience.Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)While we have put in significant effort\u2014spending2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)to secure good scores\u2014we still find ourselvesstruggling to meet expectationsfor theprojects and RoE, which are significantly harder than anticipated.We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives."

    "content": "Hi@s.anand@jkmadathil@Bharathi@carlton@Jivraj@Saransh_SainiCould you please look into the above issue?Additionally, I\u2019d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring:Grading ConcernsFinal Course Score:T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F(The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.)From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered \u201cimpossible\u201d by students:What\u2019s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?.Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores.Furthermore, for Project 1 (deadline: 16th Feb 2025), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.Course Structuring & Scheduling IssuesMany students pursuing this course aredual-degree students or working professionals, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.Thelast-minute guidancefor projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.Thestructuring and scheduling of sessionsfeel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.Request for ImprovementTo ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2, well in advance of the deadline.More structured and accessible support, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.Better management of exam difficulty levels, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response."

    "content": "Thank you@A_LAKSHMIfor the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that thegrading pattern will not be changed.  And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check thisDiscourse threadwhere students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact thefirst page of the TDS courseGA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:This course is quite hardHere\u2019s students\u2019 feedback:Itusedto be an easy course until 2024.###Now it\u2019s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible.###Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses.###LLMs grade you \u2013 unpredictably.##The ROE is hard.#Take Graded assignment 1to check if you\u2019re ready for this course.Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It\u2019ll be too tough for you now.TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this -Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for helpAgain to quote Anand:We encourage learning by sharingYouCANcopy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).Why should you copy?Because in real life, there\u2019s no time to re-invent the wheel. You\u2019ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It\u2019s important to learn how to do that well.To learn well, understandwhat you\u2019re copying. If you\u2019re short of time, prioritize.To learn better, teachwhat you\u2019ve learnt.Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).Once again Anand has anice blogwhere [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble.Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is -Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just \u201ctools\u201d, it is going to consume us an eternity to master themThe point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.@22f2001640Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn\u2019t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity."

    "content": "Regarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning, I think I\u2019m speaking for a lot of my peers that we\u2019re not concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this course.I\u2019m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course.While grades don\u2019t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I\u2019m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me.I understand that the grading can\u2019t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass."

Implicit learning. \n\nImplicit learning is \u201cHow much can they answer if woken up from sleep?\u201d\nExplicit learning is \u201cHow much can they answer given time and Internet?\u201d\n\nSome may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They\u2019ll answer those in a few seconds. \nSome, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That\u2019s explicit learning. But it takes time\u2026"

    "content": "It is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later.ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.The problem is the lack of time.So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE.The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.But we will help you be as ready as possible for it.Kind regards"

    "content": "Project 1 was based on Module 1 through 3.Project 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase.We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started.The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more.We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs.Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system.Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works.Thanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP.Kind regards"

ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time).If your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you\u2026 past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the \u201chooomann\u201dSo practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard.There will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test.Kind regards"

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.Here was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure\u2019s voice emerged from the gloom, \u201cYou are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.\u201dThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal\u2014a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund\u2019s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.Miranda\u2019s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor\u2019s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor\u2019s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \""

For example, the GitHub link of the datagen.py was incorrect and I was confused due to the code not generating the expected outcome.The LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information.I am alright with it since the evaluation will be different.Now, I am really well versed with the tools taught in these weeks. Thanking the whole TDS Team for this project which was very well designed."

(On 15th Feb 1:26AM)Then when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements and yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for students to make the necessary corrections.Then once you realised your mistake, onFeb 17th at 9:11 pm ISTi.eyesteday, you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations.Then you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=\u201c21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471\u201d]image250\u00d7534 3.92 KB[/quote]showing that your files are in the correct place.We do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the deadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students.Kind regards"

Here are the highlights of the discussion:We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday.All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago)Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago)We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it.All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students:Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed.Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements.Kind regardsTDS Team"

    "content": "@carlton@Jivraj@s.anandWe truly appreciate the efforts being put by the TDS team, but not to be rude here -Why is Project 1 deadline is on Saturday and not on Sunday, as many of us are doing the coursenot as a full-timestudent. (Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn\u2019t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team\u2019s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.Thank you."

    "content": "Hi Vikram,This is because (if you watched the session, or examined the code, you would have realised that) datagen.py was designed to run inside your docker container. And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.pyInside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfilewhich then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder.So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only\u2026 please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000You create a docker image that runs this application server.You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts.Run evalute.py using uv.If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.Hope that gives clarity.Kind regards"

    "content": "Hi Hari,The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.Have you watched this session in particular?If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing itfollowed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use casesBut of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.Kind regards"

    "content": "Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn\u2019t installing directly via pip be more practical?That said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I\u2019d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently."

    "content": "Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:Isolation\u2013 Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.Reproducibility\u2013 A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.Portability\u2013 You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name)\u2022 Good for quick experimentation and testing.\u2022 Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.Using requirements.txt\u2022 Best forreproducibilityandcollaborationsince others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\u2022 Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer\u2019s setup.Specifying Versions in requirements.txt\u2022 If youdon\u2019t specify a version, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.\u2022 If youdo specify a version (package==1.2.3), you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.Handling Version Conflicts\u2022 If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.\u2022 Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\u2022 Usinggreater than/less than constraints: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\u2022 Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.Best Practices SummaryAlways use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).Use arequirements.txtfile for reproducibility.Pin versions cautiously\u2014avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.Kind regards"

But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone\u2019s project it\u2019s better to use requirements.txt.24f2006531:My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installationThe creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed.Never try to list requirements.txt.

That means indirectly, one should complete many courses diploma in programming before doing TDS.In such a case, how to drop the course Tools In Data Science(already registered) and get it replaced with another course to save time and without incurring financial losses(as dropping a course refunds only a certain percentage of fees amount paid for the course), and do it again later in terms. It\u2019s completely IIT Madras\u2019s fault since it was mentioned in the academics site that no prerequisites were required for the course while the reality turned out to be far from promises. I want to either get the course structure for the TDS revised or get it replaced with some another course; incase of some course fee difference, I will pay the difference amount."

The problem is i had few questions remaining to solve and i dont know which ones now. All of them r showing empty in the solution box. Also i didnt write my answers someplace else, so i would have to solve all the questions again? And also if i just for example for testing submit solution of 1 question now then my score would get reduced from 7.25 to the marks of that 1 question i submitted right?"

While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses.Additionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don\u2019t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials.I would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there\u2019s a better way to balance this.PS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs  or  mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable."
